# Welcome

Ok so what we are building here is really quite like what github has as a project database andtask development and tracking for programmers to code.

We are working on a similar system tuned for people to communicate/build/create/ maintain the functions of a society on an open, learning, logistical task network that has even that next level of everyday user accessibility to reach out to all humans in need, truly as the resource that builds the body of The Guide to create a community network for all human functions and interactions as open and known so that participation levels and structures can be created with a level of trust and community through organized efforts and actions.

So first initial thoughts?

Please read first notes and we can proceed from there. The network should have open, free and communal in mind, and should be created by users. All we can do is show a framework with grace from research and connectedness. Through knowing what we are building as something good for more than ourselves we free ourselves from constraint of unjustified regulation.

Freedom through knowledge and awareness. Creation through kindness for our children. Peace through grace.
